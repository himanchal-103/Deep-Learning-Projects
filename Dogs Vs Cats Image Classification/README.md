# Dogs Vs Cats Image Classification

## Objective
The objective of the "Dogs vs Cats Image Classification Using CNN" project is to develop a robust and efficient convolutional neural network (CNN) model capable of accurately distinguishing between images of dogs and cats.

## Dataset
The "Microsoft Cats vs. Dogs Dataset" on Kaggle contains 25,000 labeled images of cats and dogs, divided equally into 12,500 images for each category. The dataset is commonly used for binary image classification tasks, providing a substantial amount of data for training and evaluating machine learning models, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Each image is in JPG format and varies in size.
