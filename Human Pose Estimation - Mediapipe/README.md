# HUMAN POSE ESTIMATION - MEDIAPIPE

## Aim
The objective of this project is to utilize Mediapipe's Pose module to detect and visualize human pose landmarks in real-time for both static images and video streams, providing clear visual feedback through annotated images and keypoint extraction.

## Mediapipe
MediaPipe is a versatile framework that facilitates the development of perception pipelines, offering pre-built solutions for real-time face, hand, and body landmark detection, enabling efficient and accurate processing across various platforms and devices.

Mediapipe identifies 33 key points on the human body, including facial features, hands, torso, and legs, which are essential for accurate body movement analysis. Each point is labeled with its corresponding index and name, providing a comprehensive reference for pose estimation.
