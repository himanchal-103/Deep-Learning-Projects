# MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition
This project is a simple implementation of a Handwritten Digit Recognition system using the MNIST dataset. 
This project aims to train a model to classify handwritten digits accurately. Convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture is used, which is well-suited for image classification tasks.

**Dataset**
The MNIST dataset is a collection of 28x28 pixel images of handwritten digits (0-9). The MNIST dataset included in this project consists of 60,000 training and 10,000 test images.

Below are the sample images from a dataset with labels.

**Neural Network**
A convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging both the Sequential and Functional APIs. 
Sequential API offers a straightforward, linear approach to constructing models layer by layer, while Functional API provides flexibility for building complex architectures with multiple inputs and outputs.
